# Analyst

A sentimental analysis plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) inspired by [750words](https://new.750words.com).
The plugin can be used for free with your own OpenAI API Key. Or get a License key from my [Gumroad](https://store.pybash.xyz/l/analyst).

The plugin uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyse your words and general essence and then generate an analysis. The plugin is not very customizable yet, I'm working on that. For starters, it shows the basic mindset of your current note in the status bar, whenever you switch to a new file.

On analysing a file(using the command palette), the analysis result is shown in a new pane.
